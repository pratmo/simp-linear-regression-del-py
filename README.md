## simp-linear-regression-del-py

In this example, we build a simple linear regression machine learning model by performing EDA and doing necessary transformations to select the best model using Python for predicting the delivery time of food.

We used square root transformation and also logarithmic transformation to check for moderately positively skewed data to improve the accuracy of our model.
